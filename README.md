Task-3: Iris Flower Classification
The Iris flower dataset encompasses three distinct species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species are distinguishable based on specific measurements. Our objective is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately categorizing Iris flowers into their respective species, utilizing their measurements.

Our task involves utilizing the Iris dataset to create a model that can classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. This dataset is widely used for introductory classification tasks.
